# PhotoApiApp
I have made this App using Api which gives data related to album and images.I used this api and fetch data related to albums and photos using volley library . Images was retrieved in recycler View with the help of picasso Library. You will get to see the Album list , where you can see the number of albums and further by clicking on album you can view the photos related to that specific album also you can have a search on album filter by their title. A very Nice App to learn for a beginner with API's.
